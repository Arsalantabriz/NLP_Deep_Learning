# About Dataset
## What's In The Deep-NLP Dataset?
Sheet_1.csv contains 80 user responses in the response_text column to a therapy chatbot. Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'.  User responded. The user can continue talking to the bot if a response is 'not flagged'. If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help.

 Classify responses as flagged or not flagged.
