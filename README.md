# About Dataset
## What's In The Deep-NLP Dataset?
Sheet_1.csv contains 80 user responses, in the response_text column, to a therapy chatbot. Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'.  User responded. If a response is 'not flagged', the user can continue talking to the bot. If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help.

 Classify responses as flagged or not flagged.
